# Anecdotal Bias

- Preference of anecdotal over statistical evidence

--

- Tested using statistics only vs. anecdote & statistics conditions

???

- The finding that people prefer anecdotal over statistical evidence
- Usually has medical content
  - That is, "data shows this treatment is 80% effective, but here's a story
    about someone that it didn't work for"
- Tested by comparing a condition with only statistics and a condition with both
  an anecdote and statistics.
  - Anecdotal bias is seen when people are less likely to say they'll use the
    treatment in the combined condition than when only seeing the statistics.

# Anecdotal Bias in Business

???

- This has typically been investigated in a medical context, but this kind of bias may be an issue in business settings because of the focus on case studies in business schools. Also, there has been a trend over the last few decades for firms to diversify, so when informing their decision-making they are more likely to look for examples outside the firm, as opposed to examples within the firm.

- In an email message, an colleague described having had a bad experience with
  the top-rated Machine A and stated how she "could not recommend it as a wise
  choice."

```

.footnote[

`r Citep(bib, "wainberg2018")`

]

???

- If the anecdote makes the target project look bad, anecdotal bias is seen when
  people allocate less to the combined condition 

---

# Effect of Similarity

???

- Some results show that people are more persuaded by similar rather than
  dissimilar anecdotes.

- "Sixteen claims on different specific cases were developed, for instance, the
  claim that extending the wine list would lead to more customers buying drinks
  in a diner in a midsized town in the southern part of the Netherlands"
- "After each short text, the claim was repeated and participants had to
  indicate how likely they regarded the consequence to occur on a 7-point scale
  ranging from 'very unlikely' to 'very likely.'"

# The Experiment

---

## Research Questions

- Would the similarity of an anecdote affect anecdotal bias?

--

- Would this depend on anecdote valence?

---

## Design

- Evidence type

  - Anecdote & statistics
  - Statistics only

--

- Anecdote similarity
  - Low
  - High

--

- Anecdote valence
  - Negative
  - Positive

--

- N = 48
  - Sample: Prolific
  - Within-subjects

  "project_allocation_anecdote_valence_negative_similarity_low.png"
) %>%
  image_read() %>%
  image_trim()
```

???

- Participants were shown two focal projects
- The target project was made to be either similar or dissimilar to the anecdote
- I measured allocation to the target

- An example of the anecdote display in the negative valence, low similarity
condition of Experiment 2.

An example of the focal projects in the negative valence, low similarity
condition of Experiment 2. Here, Project 1 was the target project and Project 2
was the comparison project.

An example of an anecdote display in the positive valence, high similarity

An example of the focal projects in the positive valence, high similarity
condition of Experiment 2. Here, Project 2 was the target project and Project 1
was the comparison project.

## Instructions

--

- Statistics: aggregated data from thousands of other projects

--

- Anecdote: randomly sampled

  - All anecdotes in the pool were equally similar to the target project

  - A part of aggregated data

---

## Hypotheses

--

### Negative Valence

.pull-left[

#### High Similarity

- Statistics only > anecdote & statistics 
  - Positive difference score

]

.pull-right[

#### Low Similarity

- Statistics only = anecdote & statistics 

]

--

### Positive Valence

.pull-left[

#### High Similarity

- Statistics only < anecdote & statistics 
  - Negative difference score
 
]

.pull-right[

#### Low Similarity

- Statistics only = anecdote & statistics 

]

# Conclusion

---

## Summary

--

- Evidence for anecdotal bias

--

- Depends on anecdote similarity

--

- Both in negative and positive anecdotes

---

## Theoretical Implications


- People are sensitive to underlying relevance

--

- People ignore sample distribution information

--

## Practical Implications

- If reference data available:

  - Consider distribution of similarity across sample

--

- If reference data unavailable:

  - Consider structural similarity of anecdote to target

---

## Next steps

- Replicate with managers

???

- This work was with lay people, but we are planning on replicating this work but with managers of real
  businesses.

--

- Decision aids

???

- We are also interested in testing various ways of helping people understand sample distribution and anecdote relevance.
